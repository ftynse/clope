Generate extra semantic information about parallelizable loops in the
polyhedral model by using Candl dependence analysis algorithm.

Usage:
$ clope < input.scop > output.scop
Generates Loop extension in the output OpenScop representation.

Coupled usage with PeriSCoP toolkit:
$ clan input.c -o stdout | clope | cloog -openscop stdin > output.c
Generate OpenMP parallel for pragmas for all loops that may be executed in
parallel.
